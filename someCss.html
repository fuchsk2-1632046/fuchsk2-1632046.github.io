                        Beloved in England, Corgis have been part of the 
                        British Royal Family for over 70 years. 
                        Queen Elizabeth II has owned more than 30 Corgis

                        Corgis evolved into two types, the Cardigan and the Pembroke, 
                        which were not recognized as separate breeds until the 1930s.
